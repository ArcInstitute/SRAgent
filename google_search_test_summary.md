# Google Search Functionality Test Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the results of testing the Google search functionality in the SRAgent codebase.

## Test Environment
- Conda environment: `sragent-env`
- Google Search API keys: Properly configured in environment variables
- Test script: `test_google_search.py`

## Functions Tested
1. `google_search`: Basic search function that directly calls the Google Custom Search API
2. `find_publication_id_with_retry`: Function that retries searches with backoff
3. `google_search_tool`: LangChain tool wrapper for the search functionality

## Test Results

### Search Term Results
| Search Term | Results | Notes |
|-------------|---------|-------|
| SRP557106 | 0 | Original accession, no results found |
| SRP009262 | 1 | Different SRA accession, one result found |
| PRJNA192983 | 0 | BioProject accession, no results found |
| GSE63525 | 2 | GEO accession, two results found |
| "Hi-C method" | 2 | Scientific method in quotes, two results found |
| bioinformatics | 2 | General term, two results found |

### Function Behavior
- All functions are working correctly from a technical perspective
- The search results depend on the Google Custom Search Engine configuration and the availability of content on the web
- Some accession numbers may not have associated publications or may not be indexed by Google

### Warnings
1. `file_cache is only supported with oauth2client<4.0.0`
   - This is a known warning from the Google API client library
   - It doesn't affect functionality
   - It indicates that the library is using a newer version of oauth2client that doesn't support file caching
   - Can be ignored or fixed by downgrading oauth2client if needed

2. `The method BaseTool.__call__ was deprecated in langchain-core 0.1.47 and will be removed in 1.0. Use :meth:~invoke instead.`
   - This is a deprecation warning from LangChain
   - The tool still works but should be updated to use the `invoke` method in the future

## Recommendations
1. For the `oauth2client` warning:
   - Option 1: Ignore the warning as it doesn't affect functionality
   - Option 2: Downgrade oauth2client to a version < 4.0.0
   - Option 3: Update the code to use a different caching mechanism

2. For the LangChain deprecation warning:
   - Update the code to use the `invoke` method instead of directly calling the tool

3. For search functionality:
   - Consider using multiple search strategies for accession numbers
   - Some accessions may need to be searched with additional context (e.g., "NCBI SRP557106")
   - GEO accessions seem to have better search results than SRA accessions

## Conclusion
The Google search functionality is working as expected from a technical perspective. The variation in search results is due to the availability of content on the web and the configuration of the Google Custom Search Engine. The warnings observed during testing do not affect functionality and can be addressed in future updates.
